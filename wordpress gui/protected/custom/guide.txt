This section is to display custom item level customizations to the section window when selected.

The file must be named exactly how the table name is to appear within i2b2's table access.

You'll be passed an XML variable in the field $selected_item_options.

the variables generated will be saved automatically by the studiessave.php page, if the variables are named:

	CUSTOM_SECTION_ITEM_ $item->C_TABLE_CD .

thus i2b2_FLOW's data, to save the ID 12 would be 

CUSTOM_SECTION_ITEM_i2b2_FLOW_12.

This is then encoded into the XML in this field.
